## Introduction
Template project for building AVR based firmware using CMake and the AVR toolchain. This projects requires a couple different tools to be installed as well as a handful of CMake variables must be updated in the ```CMakeLists.txt``` file to make the compilation specific to your project. If you already know what those are and have completed it, great, happy tinkering! - otherwise you can checkout the [docs](https://www.greatlakesdev.io/docs/avr-cmake-template/) for an in depth guide on how to use this template.
